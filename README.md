This library and the associated scripts serve two functions:

1. Provide a Haskell client library for OpenTripPlanner (boring).
2. Try to solve the problem of riding an entire transit system in the shortest
possible time (also boring, unless you are crazy, which I am).

If you have the current (as of April 23, 2017) NJ Transit schedule installed
in OpenTripPlanner, you can see one successful permutation by running:
WhitherNJT 2834041 1

I hope to update this repo soon with a better explanation of the computer
science at work here.
